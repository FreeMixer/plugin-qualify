# Building plugin-qualify

You need Node.js 18 or newer and pnpm 10 (`npm install -g pnpm@10`, or `corepack enable`). The
Python tools need Python 3 and, to scan real plugins, the lilv bindings (`python3-lilv` on Fedora,
`python3-lilv` on Debian). The tests use `pytest`.

```
pnpm install            # also compiles src/ into dist/
pnpm test               # the TypeScript tests
pnpm lint               # type-check everything, tests included
pnpm check:generated    # tools/_declarations.py matches src/qualify-declarations.ts
pnpm test:py            # the Python tools' tests
```

`tools/_declarations.py` is generated from `src/qualify-declarations.ts` so the Python scanner and
benchmark read the same rates, quanta and timeouts as the TypeScript code. After changing the
declarations, regenerate it and commit both:

```
node tools/gen-python-declarations.mjs --write
```

The container image (`Containerfile`) bundles lilv, the distribution's mod-host and an
AddressSanitizer build of mod-host:

```
podman build -t plugin-qualify -f Containerfile .
```

## Packages

The npm package, the RPM and the DEB are made from this tree; a release is a `v<version>` tag.

```
npm pack --dry-run                                # the files npm would publish
packaging/build.sh "$PWD/root" /usr/lib           # the same files, installed into ./root
rpmbuild -ba packaging/plugin-qualify.spec        # needs the source tarball in ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES
dpkg-buildpackage -b -uc -us                      # the DEB
```

`CHANGELOG.md` is the only changelog. After editing it, regenerate the spec's `%changelog` and
`debian/changelog` with `changelog.sh sync` from the
[FreeMixer/.github](https://github.com/FreeMixer/.github) changelog action; CI refuses a tree where
they differ. Bump `version` in `package.json` and `Version:` in the spec with it.

The tag publishes the RPM and DEB through the shared workflows of FreeMixer/.github and the npm
package through npm trusted publishing (`.github/workflows/publish-npm.yml`, no token). Pull requests
build both package kinds as a dry run and publish nothing.
